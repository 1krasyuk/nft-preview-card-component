## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

The main focus of this project was applying a **mobile-first approach** and achieving a **pixel-perfect match** with the design.  
I challenged myself to complete it in **under 2 hours**, which made it a great exercise in working quickly while still maintaining clean, semantic code.
Key things I focused on: 

- Writing layouts in a **mobile-first** approach for better responsiveness.  
- Keeping the codebase **clean and minimal**, avoiding unnecessary complexity.  
- Using **semantic HTML** to ensure proper structure and accessibility.  
- Achieving **pixel-perfect** alignment with the design.
